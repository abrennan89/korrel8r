= About rules

Rules are the key to Korrel8r, they express relationships between classes, possibly in _different domains_.

A Rule applies to an object of a _start_ class, and generates a query for a _goal_ class.
The start and goal can be in different domains (e.g. `k8s:Pod` â†’ `log:application`)

A rule definition contains a _template_ that produces a _query_ in the vocabulary of the _goal domain_.
The template uses fields from the _start class_ in the vocabulary of the _start domain_.
Rules are bridge between domains different vocabularies, schema, labels and query languages.
