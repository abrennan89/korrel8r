= Installing Korrel8r

You can install Korrel8r on a Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster by using the Operator provided in the GitHub repository.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following procedure may work a Kubernetes cluster that is not a Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster if the link:https://olm.operatorframework.io/[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)] is installed. However, this has not been tested.
====

Installing Korrel8r on a Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster means that you can use the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/web_console/web-console-overview.html[Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console] to view Korrel8r data.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrator permissions on an Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster version 4.12 or newer.
* You have installed the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.html#cluster-logging-deploy-console_cluster-logging-deploying[Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator] provided by Red{nbsp}Hat.
* You have installed the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/logging/cluster-logging-loki.html#logging-loki-gui-install_cluster-logging-loki[Loki Operator] provided by Red{nbsp}Hat, and have created a `LokiStack` custom resource (CR).
* You have link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.html#configuring-log-storage-cr_cluster-logging-deploying[created a `ClusterLogging` CR that configures LokiStack as the log store].

.Procedure

. Install the link:https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/[`operator-sdk` command].
. Create a namespace for Korrel8r by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create namespace korrel8r
----

. Install the Korrel8r Operator by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk -n korrel8r run bundle quay.io/korrel8r/operator-bundle:latest
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. In the *Provided APIs* column, click *Korrel8r*.
. In the *Korrel8RS* page, click *Create Korrel8r*.
. Use the default configuration and click *Create*.
. To enable the Console plugin, annotate the `ClusterLogging` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch -n openshift-logging --type merge --patch \
'{"metadata":{"annotations":{"logging.openshift.io/preview-korrel8r-console":"enabled"}}}' \
clusterlogging/instance
----

. Refresh the web console
. Navigate to *Observe* -> *Logs*. Click the *Metrics* link to see correlated metrics of each log record.
. Navigate to *Observe* -> *Alerting*, and click an alert. Alerts that have related logs have a *see related logs* link.
+
[NOTE]
====
Many alerts do not have related container logs. Only alerts relating to a particular pod or deployment have related logs, for example, `KubePodCrashLooping` alerts.
====

.Removing Korrel8r

* Delete the Operator and custom resource definitions (CRDs) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk cleanup -n korrel8r korrel8r
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
