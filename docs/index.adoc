[abstract]
Korrel8r is a _correlation engine_ that can follow relationships between diverse signal types and cluster resources.
Given a resource or signal data as a starting point, korrel8r can search for related signals or resources
in multiple different back-end signal stores, encoded using multiple different schema.

= Introduction

Korrel8r is a correlation engine for _observability signals_ and _observed resources_.
A _signal_ is a unit of observation data such as a log record, a trace record, a metric time-series, or an alert.
A _resource_ is something to be observed, such as a Kubernetes Pod, Deployment or Service.
Resources and signals are related by _rules_ that express relationships in an executable form.

Given a _start_ resource or signals (e.g. an alert in a Kubernetes cluster) and a _goal_ (e.g. _find related logs_)
the engine can search for a chain of rules (e.g. `alert -> deployment -> pod -> logs`) from start to goal.
It can also show the _neighbourhood_ of all data related to an object of interest.

The engine has a REST API
The goals of this project include:

* Encode domain knowledge from SREs and other experts as re-usable _rules_.
* Automate navigation from symptoms to data that helps diagnose causes.
* Connect data from diverse types of store, with different schema.
* Reduce multiple-step manual procedures to fewer clicks or queries.
* Help tools that gather and analyze diagnostic data to focus on relevant information.

== Many Data Models

Observability tools and observable systems tend to invent their own vocabularies or _data models_
to describe the things being observed and the data associated with an observation.

For example, consider a Kubernetes `Pod` -  the basic unit of execution in Kubernetes cluster.
Pods are identified by a name (among other things), but this name is labelled differently in different systems:

* OpenTelemetry tracees: `k8s.pod.name`
* Prometheus metrics (the de-facto standard convention for Kubernetes): `pod` or `pod_name`
* Openshift logging records: `kubernetes.pod_name`

The https://opentelemetry.io/[Open Telemetry Project] aims to create a standard vocabulary,
but in the short to medium term there are many long-lived, widely-used alternative vocabularies in use.
That is something we have to live with while we wait for "one standard to rule them all".

There are also multiple storage technologies used to store signal data,
and multiple query languages to search them.

Korrel8r tackles the diversity problem by dividing the world into a set of basic concepts called
"Domain", "Class", "Store", "Query", "Object" and "Rule".

== Domains

A Korrel8r _Domain_ represents a family of related signals and/or resources with a common vocabulary,
and related storage and query technologies. For examples see <<_domains>>.
Each `Domain` defines its own `Class`, `Object`, `Query`, and `Store`.
These abstractions allow Korrel8r to treat different domains in the same way.

Class::
A subset of objects in a Domain with a common schema for serialization.
Some domains have many classes.
<<_domain_k8s>> has a class for each resource Kind; `k8s:Pod`, `k8s:DaemonSet` and so on.
Other domains are "flat" with only a single class, for example <<_domain_alert>>

Store::
A source of stored objects from a single `Domain`.
For example:
- <<_domain_log>> uses Loki
- <<_domain_alert>> uses Prometheus
- <<_domain_k8s>> uses the Kubernetes API server.

Object::
The data associated with an individual signal or resource instance.
For example a log record, or a serialized Kubernetes resource object.

Query::
A Query selects a set of objects from a store.
The structure of a query depends on the domain, see the <<_domain>> reference for more.

== Rules

Rules are the key to Korrel8r, they express relationships between classes, possibly in _different domains_.

A Rule applies to an object of a _start_ class, and generates a query for a _goal_ class.
The start and goal can be in different domains (e.g. `k8s:Pod` â†’ `log:application`)

A rule definition contains a _template_ that produces a _query_ in the vocabulary of the _goal domain_.
The template uses fields from the _start class_ in the vocabulary of the _start domain_.
Rules are bridge between domains different vocabularies, schema, labels and query langauges.

== Examples of Objects

// TODO: JSON examples.

A Kubernetes cluster generates many types of _observable signal_, including:

[width="100%",cols="21%,79%",options="header",]
|===
|Signal Type |Description
|Metrics |Counts and measurements of system behaviour.

|Alerts |Rules that fire when metrics cross important thresholds.

|Logs |Application, infrastructure and audit logs from Pods and cluster
nodes.

|Kubernetes Events |Describe significant events in a cluster.

|Traces |Nested execution spans describing distributed requests.

|Network Events |TCP and IP level network information.
|===

A cluster also contains _resources_ that are not usually considered ``signals'',
but that can be correlated with signals and other resources:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Resource Type |Description
|k8s resources |Spec and status information.
|Run books |Problem solving guides associated with Alerts.
|k8s probes |Information about resource state.
|===

Korrel8r does not distinguish between signals and resources, and refers to both as `objects`.
